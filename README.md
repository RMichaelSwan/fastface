# fastface

I made this because it took me longer than 5 minutes to get a face detector up and running from my webcam. Hopefully this will aid others in getting running in less than 5 minutes. Most of the credit goes to cvlib.

## Install

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run

python faceface.py

## What Next?

You are provided with bounding boxes for faces and associated confidences as well as an image output from OpenCV if you want it. Now you can do fun stuff like having a robot arm that follows faces, or you can use it as an entry level detector to pass onto a face feature detector. Up to you!
